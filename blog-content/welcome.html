            <i><strong>Hello World!</strong></i> as many of us computer nerds like to welcome our programs when we first expose them to the cold cruel world. But in all seriousness, Welcome reader! this is my blogsite where I rant about things, whether it be about my education, or something else I would like the world to know about, you can read it here. I created my own website hosted on GitHub. you will notice that it isnt extravagant, or too special. I purposefully created it like this to keep the plain look to resemble it to a notebook, showing plain paper and text.

            Somethings About Me:<br>
            My name is Saaim Japanwala, and I am a 19 year old student, at the <i>University of Alberta</i> studying computer science and psychology (weird combination right?). I love the colour orange, my favourite animal is a cat, and if I could live anywhere, it would have to be Zurich, Switzerland. My favourite programming language is JavaScript (even though im absolutly horrible at it and I cant write more than 1 line of code without help). I use MacOS, but on the side im also pretty well versed with Linux ("ðŸ¤“ erm akshully Gnu/Linux"), and ofcourse I use Windows to play games.
            <br><br>
            So thats kind of the gist of who <i><strong>Saaim Japanwala Really Is</strong></i>. So all in all, welcome! I hope you read something funny, or something that makes you think about something you never really thought about before, or maybe you learn something! What ever it is, I hope you have a nice day, and remember live life to the fullest and touch some grass once in a while.
